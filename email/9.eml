      <td>I would like to teach to improve my academic and communication skills and expand my career to some form of teaching.</td>
      <td>The modules I have selected are introducing and teaching some informatics and statistics applied to life sciences (LIFE721, LIFE238 and LIFE223).\nI studied physiology and biology (BSc) but also biological and medical data processing (MSc). My current research and interests are focused on the quantitative analysis of in vivo and ex vivo MRI data, and the statistical analysis between groups.\n\nLIFE721: informatics for life sciences 2 - I have a strong experience with data processing using computer and numerous softwares.\nLIFE238: Advanced Experimental Design and Analysis - I am applying different statistical tests for each of my studies, including non-parametric statistical tests. I also have some experience with different softwares such as Origin, Prism, and SPSS.\nLIFE223: Essential Skills for the Life Sciences 2 - I am particularly interested in presentation skills, how to make figures and present data to an audience broader than the community of specialists in the field.</td>
      <td>Small group lectures (<40 students), Workshops (< 40 students), Practical classes (large groups)</td>
