      <td>I am passionate about teaching as I enjoy helping others learn. I would therefore like to further strengthen my teaching skills. I am already an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and I am due to start the PGCAP this spring.</td>
      <td>I am interested in PHAR660 as I would like experience with demonstrating to large groups of students. I have only had previous experience with small groups of students so would very much like the opportunity to work with a medium or large group.\nI am interested in LIFE320 as I did this last year and enjoyed seeing the process of explaining something and seeing how the students performed. \nI am interested in LIFE223 because I believe that scientific writing is an essential skill for science students and would very much like how to help them develop this skill, as well as preparing for interviews, which are also essential due to high competition for a limited number of job opportunities. \nI am interested in LIFE342 and LIFE232 to practice my lecturing skills. I was recently a guest lecturer for 2x 1 hour lectures at the University of Chester and really enjoyed the experience. My research is also focused a little on epigenetics: looking a post-transcriptional gene regulation in osteoarthritis and I frequently carry out PCR, qPCR and gel electrophoresis in the lab.</td>
