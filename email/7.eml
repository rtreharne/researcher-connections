      <td>I have recently started working in Liverpool university as a PDRA. The focus of my research is Metabolomics and am keen to demonstrate the potential applications and benefits of metabolomics approaches and techniques for understanding various biological questions. I will also be starting a TTF scheme with Liverpool at the end of this year, and this would be a good opportunity to experience teaching and/or demonstration.</td>
      <td>During my PhD (microbial metabolomics) and previous PDRA (4 years) positions, I have acquired various laboratory and project management skills, as well as experiencing the application of multiple analytical techniques (Mass spectrometery, GC-MS, LC-MS, DIMS, infrared and Raman spectroscopy), which I think would be useful to other postgraduate students. I have also been involved in delivering various workshops, at Manchester University, on metabolomics applications.</td>
