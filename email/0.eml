Teaching is my passion and I enjoy the process of teaching and interacting with students. Beyond my research experience, I have been fortunate to get a wide range of teaching experience. I was involved in lecturing graduate and post-graduate students in the department of Human genetics, Guru Nanak Dev University, India. I also worked as a demonstrator for MSc Human Molecular Genetics course for the Department of Genomics of Common Disease, Imperial College London. Here I demonstrated workshops on Bioinformatics, PCR, Cloning, Restriction enzyme mapping, Analysis of CpG island, DNA Sequencing and NGS workflow.\nI am confident that with my expertise and my passion to learn new things, I will be able to contribute significantly to this role.</td>

My current research and interests are focused on the quantitative analysis of in vivo and ex vivo MRI data, and the statistical analysis between groups.\n\nLIFE721: informatics for life sciences 2 - I have a strong experience with data processing using computer and numerous softwares.\nLIFE238: Advanced Experimental Design and Analysis - I am applying different statistical tests for each of my studies, including non-parametric statistical tests. I also have some experience with different softwares such as Origin, Prism, and SPSS.\nLIFE223: Essential Skills for the Life Sciences 2 - I am particularly interested in presentation skills, how to make figures and present data to an audience broader than the community of specialists in the field.</td>
